# Movie-Trivia-Game

This website will contain a trivia game that will let the user guess which movie earned more at the box office.  There will be a navigation bar that will let the user select which decade's movies they want to be quizzed on, the 80's, 90's, or 2000's.  The navigation menu and the page content will change based upon the user's screen size.  A Javascript loop will dynamincally display content on the page, such the movie names and their box office grosses.  The user will also be shown their score.  The website will change it's display based on the size of the user's screen via media queries.  

The 3 Code Louisville Project requirements it will satisfy will be:

1. CSS:  A navigation menu that expands and collapses properly at desktop and mobile sizes, such as by switching between vertical and horizontal, or is opened by clicking the “hamburger” menu item

2. CSS:  Use Flexbox or CSS Grid to organize content areas based on mobile or desktop views. For example, swapping from a single column layout to a two-column layout on desktop

3. Javascript:  Create a Javascript loop that dynamically displays HTML on your page
